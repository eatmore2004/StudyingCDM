# TASK ON THIS LAB
1.	Choose a method to represent 2-valued formulas in computer memory [Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is advised].
2.	Design an algorithm that does the following:
Given: an arbitrary formula of 2-valued Boolean algebra and vales (0 or 1) of its variables.                                                                                                     Note: If you represent the formula in RPN then the algorithm for its evaluation is simple.                                                                                                           You can transform the formula in RPN by hand and enter it into your computer in RPN.                                                                                                       Another way is to enter the formula infix form and to transform into RPN automatically using some available algorithm. 
3.	Implement your algorithms using any programming language.                                  
4.	In your main() function:
-	 Enter your formula and values of its variables,
-	 Print input data, 
-	Evaluate the formula,
-	Print the result.
