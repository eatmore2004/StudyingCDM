# TASK ON THIS LAB
1.	Choose a method to represent sets in computer memory.
2.	Design an algorithm for each of the following set operations: union, intersection, compliment, difference.
3.	Implement your algorithms using any programming language.                                  Note: You cannot use any available library/package functions that implement these set operations. Do everything by yourself from scratch. We learn how to design algorithms, but not how to use packages. 
4.	In your main() function:
-	define sets A, B, C, and a universal set U,
-	print sets, 
-	call your set operation function/methods using your sets as arguments,
-	print your results.
