# TASK ON THIS LAB
Fibonacci  numbers and Hanoi towers problems and algorithms
Statement of the problem: read sections 3.4 and 10.2 of the handbook “Структури даних та алгоритми” by Dudar and Osyka in English.
1.	Write three functions in Javascript / C++ that calculate a Fibonacci number F(n)
	Recursively.
	Iteratively.
	By a closed form formula.
2.	Using these functions calculate F(n) for n = 5, 15, 30, and 50. Register the time required by each function for each value of n to produce the result.
3.	Comment on the results: 
	What is the time-efficiency of each function? 
	What is the complexity type of the Fibonacci numbers problem?
4.	Choose or design some algorithm that solves the Hanoi towers problem (prints the sequence of commands to move one disk from some peg to some other peg according to the rules of the game).
5.	Implement your algorithm.
6.	Run your program for n = 5, 15, 30, and 50. Register the time required by your function for each value of n to produce the result.
7.	Comment on the results: 
	What is the time-efficiency of your function? 
	What is the complexity type of the Hanoi towers problem?
