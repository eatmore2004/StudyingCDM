# TASK ON THIS LAB
1.	Design an algorithm for generating permutations (arrangements) of a set         {a1 ,  a2  ,… , an  }.
	Run for values of n = 5, 15, 30, 50;
	Find asymptotic assessment of the time efficiency of your algorithm;
	Comment on results.
2.	Design an algorithm for generating k-combinations (unordered k-subsets) of a set  {a1 ,  a2  ,… , an  }..
	Run for values of n = 5, 15, 30, 50;
	Find asymptotic assessment of the time efficiency of your algorithm;
	Comment on results.
3.	In your main() function:
-	 Enter n which is the number of elements in your set;
-	 Set elements are integer numbers; 
-	Run both algorithms on your set;
-	Register the time required by each algorithm to complete the task for each value of n;
-	Print the result (all permutations/combinations + time to complete the result).
